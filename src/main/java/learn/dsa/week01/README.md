# DSA Week 1 Reflection

## Week 1 - Day 1: Array Problems

### Topics Covered
- Array Reversal
- Finding Maximum in Array
- Checking Sorted Array (Ascending)
- Sum of Array Elements

### Key Learnings
- **Array Reversal**: Learned the logic of swapping elements from the two ends to reverse an array. Covered edge cases like empty and null arrays.
- **Find Maximum**: Focused on iterating through the array and finding the maximum element, considering all-negative arrays and fixing issues with incorrect loop bounds.
- **Check Sorted Ascending**: Improved the logic for detecting whether an array is sorted in ascending order by simplifying the loop and eliminating redundant checks.
- **Sum of Array Elements**: Improved the sum calculation method and ensured it works with negative numbers, and handled potential null inputs.

### Challenges
- **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases like null, empty arrays, and arrays with only one element was crucial.
- **Initial Mistakes**: Initial errors, such as incorrect loop bounds in the `findMax` function, were corrected after reflecting on the logic.

### Next Steps
- Continue practicing array-based problems.
- Start looking into more complex DSA problems like **search algorithms** and **sorting**.
- Practice edge case handling thoroughly.

### Time Spent
- 2 hours on practice problems.
- 1 hour reflecting and documenting learnings.

## Week 1 - Day 2: More Array Problems

### Topics Covered
- Reinforced concepts from Day 1
- Practiced more problems on removeDuplicates, moveZeroes,
- Attempted LeetCode problems using Day 1 logic

### Key Learnings
- **Reinforcement Helps**: Going back to basics made the concepts stronger.
- **Clarity Through Practice**: Code clarity improved when edge cases were handled properly.
- **Struggled with Simpler Problems**: Realized that logic can break under pressure, but it's okay.

### Challenges
- Couldn't solve two problems on my own.
- Felt distracted and overwhelmed during practice.

### Next Steps
- Solve 1â€“2 simple array problems later in the day to regain momentum.
- Prepare for Day 3 by brushing up **binary search** and **rotate array** problems.
- Focus on steady progress.

### Time Spent
- 1 hour practice
- 30 min reflecting and debugging

### Resources Used
- LeetCode
- Internal utility methods from Day 1
- Reflection notes
