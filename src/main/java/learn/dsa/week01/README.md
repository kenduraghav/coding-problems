# DSA Week 1 Reflection

## Week 1 - Day 1: Array Problems

### Topics Covered
- Array Reversal
- Finding Maximum in Array
- Checking Sorted Array (Ascending)
- Sum of Array Elements

### Key Learnings
- **Array Reversal**: Learned the logic of swapping elements from the two ends to reverse an array. Covered edge cases like empty and null arrays.
- **Find Maximum**: Focused on iterating through the array and finding the maximum element, considering all-negative arrays and fixing issues with incorrect loop bounds.
- **Check Sorted Ascending**: Improved the logic for detecting whether an array is sorted in ascending order by simplifying the loop and eliminating redundant checks.
- **Sum of Array Elements**: Improved the sum calculation method and ensured it works with negative numbers, and handled potential null inputs.

### Challenges
- **Edge Cases**: Handling edge cases like null, empty arrays, and arrays with only one element was crucial.
- **Initial Mistakes**: Initial errors, such as incorrect loop bounds in the `findMax` function, were corrected after reflecting on the logic.

### Next Steps
- Continue practicing array-based problems.
- Start looking into more complex DSA problems like **search algorithms** and **sorting**.
- Practice edge case handling thoroughly.

### Time Spent
- 2 hours on practice problems.
- 1 hour reflecting and documenting learnings.
